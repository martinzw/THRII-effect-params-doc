** Diagrams for the Compressor **

Method:

With a function generator i created a 460Hz sine signal and fed it to the guitar input.
I chose 460Hz because it is a normal musical frequency 
and the compressor seems to build a high pass filter, damping lower frequencies.

-All effects except compressor switched off
-No Amp simulation  ("Flat")
-No Cabinet simulation
-Audio input turned low

The USB-digital output connected to the PC running Audacity,
to show a VU-Meter for the signal coming from the THR output,
that is the compressor output .

For a fixed "Level" setting of the compressor i made a row of measurements
with input amplitude increasing from -54dB to 0dB 
for several settings of "Sustain" setting.


**Results:**
-even with Level=0 and Sustain=0 the compressor modul has got some impact on the signal.
-even with Level=100 a 0dB input signal is attenuated by 2.6dB  
-with Sustain=100 and Level=100 a weak input signal (-54dB) is amplified by almost 30dB
-louder signals gain much less amplification 
-loud signals above -3dB are never amplified.

**Sustain setting**
  Weak signals are amplified by
  + 3 dB for Sustain =  0
  +12 dB for Sustain = 30 
  +20 dB for Sustain = 50 
  +27 dB for Sustain = 80
  +30 dB for Sustain =100

**Level setting**
 Attenuates the compressor output by:
 -36  dB  for Level= 0
 -27  dB  for Level=30
 - 5  dB  for Level=79
 - 2.6dB  for Level=100
